    // Variables are immutable  by default
    // mut allows them to be mutable
    // ::new() means that new is an associated function of the string type
    // result: created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a String
    let mut guess = String::new(); //String::new() means that new is an associated function(a function implemented by a type)

    //  std::io::Stdin is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for the terminal
    io::stdin()
        // & denotes a reference parameter
        // read_line takes in user input and returns a value, in this case an io::Result
        // Rust has multiple types named result
        //  - Generic Result
        //  - Specific versions for submodules, like, io::Result
        //  - Result types are enumerations(type with a fixed set of values called variants)
        //  - The variants here are ok and Err
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        // Expect is a method built on to the io::Result oject
        // Expect will take an Ok value and hold it for use

        .expect("Failed to read line");
    // This isn't the best error handling. That will be covered later.
